# STL_PIN
Integrate STL motion planning with PINN

## TODO
1. Add labels for different states in transducers. So that the monitor can be resumed when the trajectory is extended.
2. Exam STL-RRT with nonlinear dynamic system.
3. Exam STL_RRT integrated MPC.
4. Build up the control loop for hierarchical MPC with PINN.
